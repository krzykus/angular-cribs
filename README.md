Learning Angular with a course on [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/getting-started-with-angular-2/)
using Android phone with [Termux App](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.termux)

Stuff that needs to be installed in Termux otherwise you will have bunch of errors&ast;:
* python2
* make


&ast; there may be something else as my "enviroment" was not clean.
